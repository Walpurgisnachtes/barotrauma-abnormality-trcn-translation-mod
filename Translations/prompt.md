Mod name: Abnormalities
Mod description:
A large mod intended to eventually add all of the content from the Project Moon universe into Barotrauma. All of the items in this mod have been painstakingly crafted to be relatively balanced - sure, you can get powerful gear, but you'll have to work quite a bit to get your hands on it.

The main features of this mod:
Abnormalities: Ranging from hostile to friendly, monstrous to cute, these creatures can either greatly benefit you or kill your entire crew, depending on how you choose to confront them. Each one has its own unique design and abilities, and should be approached with caution to maximize your chances of survival. The rewards for overcoming these creatures are immense; however, E.G.O., or gear manifested from the psyche of these monsters, is a powerful tool for overcoming this world's hardships. Be careful when wielding powerful gear, however, or the mind of the monster might override your own...
Factions: Monsters aren't the only thing you have to worry about; there's also your fellow man. Syndicates, Corporations, and Fixers alike are all vying for power in this desolate world, and you've got no choice but to beat them to it. Ally with them or make enemies with them, buy their gear or take it off their corpses, the choice is yours.
Gear: The variety of unique outfits and weaponry you have to choose from is nigh-endless, and you'll be sure to find an archetype that fits you.
