  <loadingscreentip>Abnormalities are graded based on their risk level: ZAYIN, TETH, HE, WAW, and ALEPH.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Abnormalities can drop EGO Gifts, items which are infused with their essence and willpower. These gifts often have powerful abilities and should be exploited.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Behold the Abnormalities. Don't lose your Sanity.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Face the Fear, Build the Future.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Blubbering Toad "Glupo" is a ZAYIN grade Abnormality. Rather than croak, it makes crying noises. If appeased, it will occasionally drop Melty Eyes that cure insanity.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Croohoo, croohoo.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Don't Touch Me is a ZAYIN grade Abnormality which takes the form of a button. When pressed, it [REDACTED].</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>You've been pressing it numerous times and you still have something you want to know about it?</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>One Sin and Hundreds of Good Deeds is a ZAYIN grade Abnormality. This floating skull, if appeased, is capable of healing the entire crew's sanity.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>It feeds on the evil that seeps out during conversations between people.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Punishing Bird is a TETH grade Abnormality. It is typically harmless and beneficial, but if enraged it will become indiscriminate and lethal.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>People have been committing sins since long ago. Why do they commit sins, knowing it's wrong?</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Forsaken Murderer is a TETH grade Abnormality. This criminally insane prisoner should be treated with caution, lest it escape its cell and go on a rampage.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>What's really pitiful is people like you dying to the likes of me.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>So That No One Will Cry is a TETH-grade Abnormality. This large wooden doll is covered in talismans which allow it to inflict Rupture with each hit.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>You hear the quiet flickering of candles. In this cramped room, you find a wooden doll, standing. Are the talismans filling the room for a wish? Does this wooden doll wish for anything?</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Proceeding Inquisitor and Everything There of an Inquisitor are TETH grade corrosions. They are created as a result of using Nothing There's EGO and corroding.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The Ordeal of Amber Dawn is a TETH-grade Ordeal. It can sometimes be found in outposts.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>KQE-1J-23 is a HE grade abnormality. Its health may be relatively low, but fighting it alone is a death sentence due to its Captivity ability.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Der Freischütz is a HE grade abnormality. This bloodthirsty mercenary can be hired, for a cost.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>This magical bullet can truly hit anyone, just like you say.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Headless Ichthys is a HE grade abnormality. Its size makes it easy to trap it in tight corridors, but its blood jet ability is extremely lethal.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The Naked Nest is a WAW grade Abnormality. This nest of parasites is not very dangerous in and of itself, but the parasites its spawns have fatal infectious bites. The nest and its worms are weak to fire.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>It can enter your body through any aperture.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The only way to cure Exuviae Infection is with Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics, so keep some around.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Wayward Passenger is a HE-grade Abnormality. Its dimensional blades can inflict Rupture, allowing it to deal escalating damage against its foes. Beware of its High Speed Rip Space.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>You see a poor passenger, stranded between dimensions. Most will never realize that this person ever disappeared.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The Ordeal of Amber Dusk is a WAW-grade Ordeal. These larger worms can spawn smaller worms intermittently, so kill them before they get too numerous.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Spiral of Contempt is a WAW-grade Abnormality. Spiral of Contempt is a mass of twisted gold branches roughly in the shape of a person.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Worthless wretch, your worth is not enough to even lay a finger on me.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Nothing There is an ALEPH grade abnormality. This towering monster is constantly trying to mimic humans, and as it was met with violence, it mimics violence.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>And the many shells cried out one word, "Captain."</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Blue Star is an ALEPH grade abnormality. Barely comprehensible, this creature does not seem to show any emotion towards those it harms.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Let us meet again as stars.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>CENSORED is an ALEPH grade abnormality. Its true form is so horrid, it must be censored to prevent immediate insanity.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>If a flaw in the system disables the censors covering the Abnormality, we will once again have to sincerely consider how to dispose of the captain.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Melty Eyes are consumables that heal sanity and deliriumine poisoning.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Penitence is a crown of thorns that grants the wearer Vigor.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Regret is a potent blunt force weapon which also slows the target down considerably.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Corroded Inquisitor equipment can be salvaged from fallen Inquisitors and freely used.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Sunshower is a plush sleeping fox holding an umbrella. As its parent Abnormality is practically nonexistent under Europa's oceans, it is a very rare and valuable find.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Pinpoint Logic Circuit is a seemingly perfect version of an FPGA circuit which can interface with organic brains.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Fluid Sac is not only a potent blunt force weapon, it also heals the user on hit. The only drawback is requiring blood.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Mimicry is a weaponized blade from Nothing There's arm. It is very effective in close quarters.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>"These chains represent solidarity and connection. Together, we who are bound by the same chain bear the responsibilities hand in hand. We will face our destinies and share the weight together. We have no need to remove these chains. We have no means to remove these chains. And we have no need for those who intend to remove these chains."</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>"Many things are written in the Book of Vengeance, from instructions for avenging a Brother's death to instructions for avenging getting our foot stepped on in the streets."</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>"Little mistakes may occur within a family. It is my little joy to sweep such mistakes under the rug. I have been taught that is true loyalty."</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>"Us junior Brothers do not concern ourselves with seniority amongst ourselves. It is a detail of very little significance. All we wish to do is support each other and our senior Brothers, no more."</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>"The Middle always pays their debts. There are no 'little mistakes,' unless the mistake is from one of us."</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>W Corp denies all involvement with the existence of Wayward Passenger and claim its appearance is merely a coincidence.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>W Corp, or WARP Corp, is responsible for the advent of experimental teleportation technology. Although it's best used sparingly to avoid side effects, it can significantly shorten return trips to the submarine. All you need is a WARP Teleportation Anchor and a WARP Recall Device.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>R Corp Fourth Pack's Rabbit Team is known for its high agility and aggressive tactics. Their portable coilguns can pack one of three different ammo types; standard, piercing, and explosive. Their suits provide a degree of protection against pressure and low oxygen, allowing them to operate anywhere on Europa with impunity and largely ignore the threat of breaches.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>R Corp Fourth Pack's Rhino Team specializes in demolition and heavy weapons. These power armor clad behemoths tear down everything in their way with impunity, and if the huge metal suit wasn't intimidating enough, they can move much, much faster than you'd expect. </loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>That's that, and this is this.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The Kurokumo Clan is notable for its focus on swordplay, and is recognizable by their extensive augmentation tattoos, which depict the black clouds they are named after. Their main form of revenue is extortion, such as requiring tolls for passage between territories, or payments from Nest citizens in exchange for "protection".</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The Kurokumo Clan is one of the twenty subsidiaries of The Thumb.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Like many other Syndicates, the Kurokumo Clan presents a strict hierarchy: at its head is the Patriarch (組長, Kumichō), under which are his Captains (頭, Kashira), which command groups composed of their henchmen, or Wakashu (若衆, Wakashū). At the death of a Captain, the next Captain will inherit their team, as well as the Captain's sword, the Kokuuntō.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The Patriarch of the Kurokumo Clan is a famed swordsman, who used to be numbered among the Ten Blades of the East. The Patriarch lost his claim to the title: following Captain Sayo's team's failure to complete a mission on behalf of the Thumb, his left hand was cut off, severely hindering his swordplay.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The Blade Lineage hail from District 19, the territory of S Corp. According to Aeng-du, the faction left in search of a better home due to the instability and corruption in the district, spreading out throughout the City. This resulted in much conflict, since most other areas in the City were already controlled by other Syndicates and factions. </loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Similar to the other four Fingers, the Thumb has a unique Syndicate culture and creed that all members follow fervently. Compared to the other Fingers, the Thumb is considered the most refined of the four. However, they are as refined as they are strict; any action that breaks their established hierarchy will meet immediate punishment, and anyone related to those related to the rule breaker wind up punished as well.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Soldatos of the eastern branch of the Thumb use a different weapon than those of the southern branch. Instead of a functioning musket with a bayonet attached, their firearm has been heavily modified to fully serve as a melee weapon; the barrel of their musket now ends with a blade, and features a retractible propeller on their top, which make use of their ammunition to boost the speed and force of their attacks. Additionally, their weapon possesses a cylinder much like a revolver's, where their ammunition is stored.</loadingscreentip>

  <faction.middle>The Middle</faction.middle>
  <faction.middle.description>The Middle has an extremely tight-knit 'familial' structure, and Syndicate members share close fraternal ties with each other; members of the Middle call each other "Brothers" and "Sisters", and rank in the group is denoted by seniority in the family. The emphasis on family is more than superficial: parties are thrown for new members, and large group dinners are often held, which family members are expected to attend. The Middle has a completely different attitude towards outsiders. Any slight (or "sin", as members call them) done to a member of the Middle or its property (including assets and subservient Syndicates) will be recorded on the "Book of Vengeance" (which members carry around on their waists), and promptly avenged for, usually within the space of a few days.</faction.middle.description>

  <faction.ring>The Ring</faction.ring>
  <faction.ring.description>Formal members of the Ring are eccentric artists enamored with the creation of artistic pieces (mostly of the modernist movements), usually related in some way to the human condition. To this end, members exemplify human suffering in their pieces by perpetrating it in highly gruesome and visual manners. Residents of areas under control of the Ring are required to regularly attend "tests" held by the Syndicate and display sufficient artistic aptitude and taste to ensure continued protection from said Syndicate.</faction.ring.description>

  <faction.fixers>Fixers</faction.fixers>
  <faction.fixers.description>Fixers are the handymen of Europa, who can be hired for a wide range of contracts, ranging from everyday errands to active combat. Becoming a Fixer requires a license from the Hana Association and from there is free to take on any request so long as they report their performance back to the Association after the job is complete. The majority of Fixers will find themselves working as a part of an Office, a type of business owned and operated by Fixers that is overseen by the Associations. A rare few Fixers operate independently.</faction.fixers.description>

  <faction.syndicates>Syndicates</faction.syndicates>
  <faction.syndicates.description>"Syndicate" is a purposefully vague and broad term that can be used to describe essentially any group of people who work together in an organized, but unregulated, group. Syndicates can do all sorts of activities, and be involved in various types of business, leading to groups with very little in common both being able to be referred to as a Syndicate. Some Syndicates focus on extorting money from people for protection, while others abduct people, kill for fun and pleasure, or do anything in between. They can be small groups that only exist in one corner of the world or large enough to exist in every station. As many Syndicates operate as a business, they have the same rights and obligations as the other businesses such as being able to hold patents on technology and needing to pay taxes.</faction.syndicates.description>

  <faction.wings>Wings</faction.wings>
  <faction.wings.description>The Wings, also known as the Wings of the World, are a group of the 26 largest, most powerful conglomerates in the world. They act as the governing bodies of the respective Nests of the City's Districts. Each Wing possesses and utilizes a Singularity, a form of technology that can blatantly violate the laws of physics. Each Wing has its own cultural style and social structure which are reflected in how it governs its Nest, and the policies the Wing sets also determines the way of life in the District's Backstreet. Wings have differing degrees of presence, influence, and benevolence with regards to their Backstreets, although their relationship is ultimately exploitative, even for more cooperative Wings. Security of borders between Nests and Backstreets also vary from plasma walls to mere chain fences, but the Wings' power is such that no one in the Backstreets dares to cross over into a Nest without express permission. </faction.wings.description>

  <faction.lobotomycorporation>Lobotomy Corporation Remnants</faction.lobotomycorporation>
  <faction.lobotomycorporation.description>Lobotomy Corporation was one of the twenty-six Wings and the owner of District 12's Nest before the corporation's collapse. L Corp.'s Singularity was the ability to materialize the human mind through a formula called Cogito, and the company used this to market itself as an eco-friendly energy producer for the City and the other Wings. Secretly, this was done through the creation and use of Abnormalities, monstrous and highly dangerous entities created from experiments with L Corp.'s Singularity.</faction.lobotomycorporation.description>
